# Segmenting-Toronto 
This project segments and clusters the Neighborhoods of the city of Toronto in order to determine the most common venues in every neighborhood.

I used Beautifulsoup python library to scrap the data from the files and obtained latitude and longitude values using geopy. I used folium library to render the toronto map and the Foursquare application to get all the information about the venues in the Toronto neighborhood. I imported K-means clustering from Scikit-learn library and used it for clustering the neighbourhoods.
